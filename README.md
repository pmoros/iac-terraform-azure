# Branching strategy

The branching strategy used in this repository is based on the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). This means that the `main` branch is the main branch and all changes are merged into it. The `main` branch is protected and requires a pull request to be merged into it. The pull request must be approved by at least one reviewer before it can be merged.
